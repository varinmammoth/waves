=====================================
BESSEL THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY CALCULATOR
=====================================

Hello fellow physicist! 

This script was designed to compute thermal diffusivity from the values of 
transmission factor and phase lag that you have obtained from the Fourier 
analysis of the data.

It uses Bessel functions of first kind, J0, which can be treated as a series 
expansion. More about this can be found in the Script's Appendix.

In this program, we can choose the number of terms that we wish to truncate J0 
to - this is controlled by the variable 'no_terms'. By default, we set 
'no_terms' = 100, which should work in most cases. If you get an error message 
saying that "the method failed to converge", lower the variable 'no_terms', 
as suggested by the message outputed. Sometimes working with too many terms 
can give rise to convergence problems!

You may use this script as a calculator, but you are very welcome to have a 
look at what it is actually doing by scrolling down a bit :)

To start, just input your data and press run!

# BESSEL TRANSMISSION AND BESSEL PHASE LAG FUNCTIONS
# =============================================================================
# General comments:
# -----------------
#   Terms in the Bessel Series are complex. They take the form:
#       -  J0 = re_in + i(im_in) ,  at r_in;
#       -  J0 = re_out + i(im_out) ,  at r_out.
#   We consider J0 as a function of alpha, where alpha = sqrt(w/D)*r_in.
#
#   The functions are designed to be used for fitting the transmission factors
#   and phase lags obtained in the Fourier analysis of the experimental data.
#    
#   A Secant root-finding method is used to find the alpha than matches
#   the Bessel phase lag / transmision values to the Fourier ones. 
#        
#   Finally, the diffusivity is obtained from alpha.
#     
# About the iterator I:
# --------------------
#   The Bessel series is obtained via an iterative process. 
#   Each iteration corresponds to 2 terms in the series, so upper limit is set 
#   to be I < (no_terms/2).
#
